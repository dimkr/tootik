## Overview

tootik is a federated federated nanoblogging service with a Gemini frontend.

tooktik allows Gemini users to participate in the fediverse using their Gemini client of choice and makes the fediverse more accessible.

It implements a small subset of ActivityPub, and probably doesn't really conform to the spec.

**This is very dirty and messy piece of code written as a weekend project.** Use with caution.
