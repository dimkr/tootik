The Common Name property of the client certificate ("identity") you use will determine your username.

You can add additional client certificates later, or revoke access for an old certificate.

There are two kinds of accounts:
* Traditional
* Portable

Traditional accounts are tied to this particular server, but provide good interoperability.

Portable accounts may suffer from interoperability issues but have several advantages:
* They're identified by an Ed25519 key pair and not tied to a particular server
* They allow replication of your data across multiple servers ("gateways"); this replication is not 100% reliable, though
* They allow migration away from this server even if it's offline

Settings → Data portability allows one to view the private key used to prove the ownership over a portable account and configure the list of gateways.
