## Registration

The username of a newly created account is the Common Name property of the client certificate ("identity") used during registration, and it must be unique among all users registered on this server.

There are two kinds of accounts:
* Traditional
* Nomadic

Traditional accounts provide good compatibility with with other servers in the fediverse, but they're tied to this server and impossible to recover or migrate if this server shuts down.

In contrast, a nomadic account can be registered on multiple servers simultaneously and migrated to another server even if this one is down. However, compatibility with other servers is very limited and there are various limitations, like inability to create polls.
