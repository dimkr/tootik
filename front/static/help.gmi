The Common Name property of the client certificate ("identity") you use will determine your username.

You can add additional client certificates later, or revoke access for an old certificate.

Settings → Data portability allows one to view the private key used to prove the ownership over an account and configure the list of gateways.

Only one account on this server can use a particular private key: if all client certificates associated with your account are lost or expired, you won't be able to register again with same key to restore access to your account.
