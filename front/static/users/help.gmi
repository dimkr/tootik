You can upload a plain text file over Titan, instead of typing your post in the input prompt (use your client certificate for authentication).

Only public posts can be quoted.

> 📊 Status

This page shows various statistics about this server and the parts of the fediverse it's connected to.

## Posts

Posts should be up to {{.Config.MaxPostsLength}} characters long.

### Links, Mentions and Hashtags

Links are detected automatically and don't need to be wrapped with HTML <a> tags or preceded by a => marker.

Mentioned users should be preceded by @, i.e. @user or @user@host. If the host part is unspecified, tootik tries to guess it using:
* The parent post author (if this is a reply)
* Followed users

To start a new thread in a community, follow the community and mention the community in a public post. The community will send the post and its replies to all followers of the community.

Tags should be preceded by #, i.e. #topic.

### Polls

Polls are posts that follow the form:

```
	[POLL Poll question] option A | option B | option C
```

For example:

```
	[POLL Does #tootik support polls now?] Yes | No | I don't know
```

Polls must have between 2 and {{.Config.PollMaxOptions}} multi-choice options, and end after {{printf "%s" .Config.PollDuration}}.

## Client Certificates ("Identities")

The username of a newly created account is the Common Name property of the client certificate used during registration.

To associate an additional client certificate with your account:
* Create a new client certificate with the same Common Name as your current certificate
* Register using the new certificate: this will add the certificate to the list of certificates waiting for your approval
* While authenticated using the old certificate, use Settings → Certificates to approve the new one
* To secure your account, use Settings → Certificates to revoke access for certificates you don't use anymore

Client certificates get rejected automatically after {{.Config.CertificateApprovalTimeout}} without approval.

## Account Migration

Successful migration should preserve followers by moving them from the old account to the new account. Posts and other user actions are not migrated.

To migrate an account to this instance:
* Register on this instance (if you haven't already)
* Set the old account as an alias of the new account
* Use Settings → Set account alias to set the new account as an alias of the old account
* Follow the account migration procedure of your existing instance

To migrate an account from this instance:
* Register an account on another instance (if you don't have one)
* Use Settings → Set account alias to set the new account as an alias of the old account
* Set the old account as an alias of the new account
* Use Settings → Move account

Migration can take time due to caching: it can take time for tootik to notice a newly added alias.

tootik does not disable the moved account, but the account cannot be moved again.
