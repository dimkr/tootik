This page shows posts by followed users and posts sent to you, grouped by day.

Posts are sorted by:
* Audience: direct messages to you, then posts that mention you, then everything else
* Relevance and popularity: the number of followed reply authors, or the total number of reply authors
* Noise: the number of posts by this author and time since the author's previous post
* Recency: the time the post was published
* Artificiality: posts by users or groups, then posts by bots

The first two links (posts from today or yesterday) are stable and don't change every day, so you can bookmark them or add them to your feed reader.

## Posts

Posts should be up to 500 characters long.

### Links, Mentions and Hashtags

Links are detected automatically and don't need to be wrapped with HTML <a> tags or preceded by a => marker.

Mentioned users should be preceded by @, i.e. @user or @user@host. If the host part is unspecified, tootik tries to guess it using:
* The parent post author (if this is a reply)
* Followed users

Tags should be preceded by #, i.e. #topic.

### Polls

Polls are posts that follow the form:

```
	[POLL Poll question] option A | option B | option C
```

For example:

```
	[POLL Does #tootik support polls now?] Yes | No | I don't know
```

Polls must have between 2 and 5 multi-choice options, and end after a month.
